        "content": "\n### The day you were born.\nFebruary 1st started off like almost any other Friday recently. I woke up at 5:30am to get ready for work and made it to the office around 7am. There was a party at the office around noon, and my plans were to enjoy some time with the people there, and head to Denver to spend the weekend with your mom. Up until this point, I've been afraid of telling people about you. I've been afraid of the possibility of losing you. I didn't want to have to tell people who were excited to meet you, that the wouldn't get the chance.\n\nThat day was different. I felt encouraged by all of the doctors who told us that you were perfect, and everything looked fine. I beamed about you to some of my co-workers at that party for the first time. I told everyone how excited I was to be a father. It felt good to tell people about you.\n\nI left the office around 2pm and made it to the hotel around 3:30pm. Your mom looked beautiful waving at me from across the street. I gave her a kiss and after that she told me that she had been feeling what she believed to be [Braxton Hicks contractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braxton_Hicks_contractions). She was in Denver for an All State Choir event, and had to sing at a special performance for directors. I brought my things up to the hotel room, and that's when your mom said: \"I can feel him moving!\". I got to feel your tiny kick through your mothers belly for the first time, and I almost cried with excitement. You were such a ball of energy in there.\n\nWe left the hotel and went to the singalong. Your mom was still feeling the contractions. The performance was beautiful. 10 floors of kids singing from balconies. I know now that they were singing the celebration songs of your arrival into our arms. Your mom looked miserable when she met me after the concert, she knew that she had to go to a hospital. On the way back to the hotel, she keeled over in the street clutching her belly in pain. We knew that we had to get to the hospital fast, but still didn't know if this was just some early pains that were natural and part of the process. We told the valet that your mom was in labor and we needed the car as quickly as possible. They ran to the lot to get it and we were out of there and on the way to the hospital. On the way your mom kept saying: \"Baby, why do you want to come now?\".\n\n### When we got to the hospital.\nI helped your mom walk into the emergency room around 7:00. We explained to the nurses that you felt like you were having contractions, and that you might be going into labor. They asked how many weeks pregnant she was, and she replied \"19\". The nurse told us that tonight we would be \"20 weeks\" since that was the earliest that they could take us into the Labor facility. \"You don't want to be in an emergency room, you want to be upstairs\" the nurse told us.\n\nA nurse pushed your mom in a wheelchair for what seemed like a mile to get to the Labor center. We were in the hospital room within about 10 minutes of getting to the hospital. They had you into a bed and started to ask your mom question after question. \"How long have you felt this?\", \"Have you been drinking water?\", \"When's the last time you pooped?\". Your mom has gone to the hospital on several different occasions for several different pains, that have ended up being some feces in her bowels. I was really hoping that the end of this story could be: \"That was the third time I took Dani to an ER where a doctor told her she was full of crap.\" This time was different, because she was full of you, and we were both full of love for you.\n\nSeveral nurses were in the room trying to gather as much information as they could about your mom. Some of them were convinced that she was dehydrated and that it was the dehydration that was making her feel contractions. She explained that she felt like she needed to go to the bathroom really bad, and they told her she should try. When she came out of the bathroom she had a worried expression on her face and said: \"Something's coming out\". They pulled an ultrasound machine into the room to examine you. \"They're perfect. Do you want to know the gender?\" We were scheduled to find out in a few weeks but wanted to know now. \"It's a boy\".\n\nThe nurses had her get on the bed and brought a light in to examine. I wanted to see what was coming out, and sure enough, a small green bag was beginning to protrude. The nurses confidence that everything was going to be okay disappeared almost immediately after seeing that. She told us: \"Sweetheart that looks like your bag. We need to get a specialist in here\". They hooked your mom up to an IV and began to draw blood to test for infections. They inverted your mom so that they could hopefully have gravity coax her amniotic sac back inside to prevent it rupturing. The doctor rushed in and said that she needed to confirm that there were no infections before starting any sort of procedure to get the sac back inside.\n\nThey told her to take deep breaths and hang tight while they made the necessary preparations. Everyone left the room and for a while it was just me and your mom. I encouraged her that everything was going to be fine and that all of the nurses and doctors were doing everything they could to make sure that you and her would be safe. Your mom suddenly felt another contraction come on and said that we needed to get nurses in the room quickly. We called a nurse in and she inspected the sac again to make sure it was still intact, before leaving one more time. Your mom was calm for a little while longer, and then she felt another rush of pain and said again: \"Get someone in here\". We called the nurse again, and this time, all of the nurses and the doctor came back in. \"We're still waiting on results to begin this operation, your doing great, and everything is going to be fine.\" They offered her a drug to ease the pain, Fentanyl. She accepted it and as they were administrating it told her that she might feel dizzy. The drug seemed to calm her down a bit and the doctor and nurses were still urging her to stay calm and wait for the results. Suddenly, there was a sound of popping and a splash of liquid as your mom's water broke. \n\n### When you were born\n\nUp until this point I had stayed hopeful. My hope was that they could find a way to make sure that you stayed inside the womb. When your mom's water broke, almost all of that hope was gone. I had just a sliver of optimism as the doctor told us \"This is it. You're having this baby, and that means that it will not live. I'm sorry.\" Even the nurses words couldn't deplete that last bit of hope that maybe they were wrong, and maybe this was just some sort of misunderstanding. Maybe your mom had two water bags for some reason. Maybe you could be born tonight, and they could save you some how. Nothing could've prepared me for what happened next. Your mom cried out and there was a loud pop and a thud as you exploded out onto the table. That noise, was like a gunshot from a gun pointed at my heart, my hope, and everything that is good in my life. I was shattered in to billions of pieces. The last sliver of hope disappeared along with the hope I had for anything good in this world. \n\n>I wept harder than I have ever cried in my life. \n\nIt wasn't a wail, but an uncontrollable heaving. My face was buried into your mother's pillow, and my hat fell off of my head. The dreams of holding you in my arms were gone. My imagination of you experience life for the first time was replaced with a feeling of wishing my life had never happened. I thought it would never end. It was truly the most pain, I've ever experienced in my entire life. \n\nYou were born at 8:05pm in St. Luke's hospital on February 2nd, 2019.\n![Meeting you for the first time](firsttime.JPG)\n### After you were born.\nI never thought anyone was ready to be a parent. I thought that I would really never be ready, and that this feeling of being unprepared was just part of having children. Any fear I had, or feeling of not being ready dissolved the moment I saw your face for the first time.\n\n\"He's perfect, and he's yours to be with tonight\". Through my tears and heaving I looked down to see my incredible son pressed against the bosom of his mother. The structure of your tiny body resembled mine so much, it was as if I was looking at a miniaturized version of myself. You were almost 10 inches tall. I couldn't believe how much you had grown in the few months since we found out that we were expecting you.\n\nWe named you \"Charles Thomas\" after your two great grandfathers: Charles Bovee, and Thomas Darr. These two men are strong warriors like you, and the name suited you perfectly, because just like them, you're a strong warrior.\n\nIn between crying I held your hand on the tip of my finger. Your tiny fingers were incredible to behold. Miniature versions of my hands. You were kicking and squirming every little while. It was such a beautiful site to behold, but was also sad, as I knew these were kicks meant to develop your reflexes in the womb and not meant for the air of the earth. You were lying sideways pressed into your mom, your tiny feet were crossed and you were so peaceful. I couldn't believe how peaceful you were. You opened your mouth and lifted your chest as if to take a huge breath. \"He just took a breath\" your mom would say to me. I was deeply troubled by the fact that this wasn't you taking a deep breath, but attempting to breathe into lungs that were not yet developed. Each time you tried to take a breath, I was filled with even more sorrow. Life is so resilient, that even with the incomplete body you were born with, you fought hard to stay alive. I could see your tiny heart beat in your tiny neck beating slower and slower.\n\nYour mom and I took turns holding you, trying to take in as much of this precious time as we could. When I held you it felt like I was holding a little furnace. So much heat and energy and life in one little ball. I touched your tiny body as much as I could, and gave you so many kisses. You were bathed in my tears. It wasn't fair. \n\nThe chaplain came in and guided me through your baptism. She had forgotten the cup of water and as she went to get it I held your precious body and the palm of my hand, and thought about how much I wanted the best for you. When she came back in she lead us in prayer and I got to take small drops of water and \"In the name of the father\" baptise you. You kicked your legs for the last time I can remember as I made a tiny cross on your chest with the water. I knew that soon you would be in heaven with your uncles.\n\n### After you went to heaven.\n\nIt was hard to tell, because your heartbeat hadn't stopped abruptly but seemed to slow down. We think that you left this world sometime between 9:45 and 10:15, though it was really difficult to say.  We continued to take turns holding you and studying every precious detail on your tiny body. Your hands, feet, knees, neck, shoulders, bottom, head, face, eyelids, fingers, and tiny fingernails. You were so precious an so perfect. I couldn't stop crying. A nurse came in around 11 and confirmed that you had passed, and took you out of the room to prepare a small memory box with pictures and keepsakes that we could look at and remember you by.\n\nWe called your grandparents to let them know. We could've filled up a pool with the amount of tears that we all cried for you that night.\n\nEventually you were brought back into the room in a tiny little bassinet with a cute little hat and blanket. We got to hold you and take pictures of you in your cute outfit until the family members started to arrive.\n\n### The night you met Nonnie, Pops and Zoe\n\nYour Grandpa \"Pops\", and Grandmother \"Nonnie\", along with your Aunt Zoe, came to the hospital around 12:30. Pops and I hugged and sobbed into one another as we both processed the situation. Nonnie wept along with Zoe and Dani on the hospital bed. Eventually they all gathered around your crib to take in the magnificence of your precious face. They would take turns holding you, and your mom and I did our best to explain the events that had taken place that evening. After an hour or two of this time, I went with your family back to the hotel that Dani and I were planning on staying in. I helped them get the car into the Valet, and went with them up to the room to collect all of your mothers things.\n\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; height: 500px; justify-content: space-between;\">\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ghettifish-llc/image/upload/a_0/v1549302184/CharlesThomas/pops.jpg\" alt=\"Meeting Pops\" width=\"45%\" class=\"image\">\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ghettifish-llc/image/upload/a_0/v1549394809/CharlesThomas/IMG_5347.jpg\" alt=\"Meeting Nonnie\" width=\"45%\" class=\"image\">\n</div>\n\n### Understanding what tragedy means\nIn the silence of the elevator ride I thought about how different life was just a few hours earlier. My dreams for this weekend. My dreams for this month. My dreams for your first year. As I collected all of your mothers things from the hotel room, the reality set in that our life would never be the same, or even close to the way we dreamed it would be. For as long as I could think, I believed that a crime was any action by someone that effected someone else negatively. That night I learned a definition for a tragedy. A tragedy can be experienced by more than one person and is the result of an event that permanently removes one's ability to dream in specific areas of their life. There are very few things that fit this category. \n\nI'm a firm believer that life is full of opportunity, and that if you don't see it right away, you might find an amazing opportunity that others missed. To me, as long as there is life, the world is full of opportunity. For some people there is less opportunity, but there is still some there. I think that the only time opportunity disappears, is when someone dies. When we die, we can't have opportunities, at least in the way that we understand them in this life. When someone else dies, we lose any chance of opportunity to experience life with them. Or at least we lose the opportunity to experience this life with them. When you passed away, my dreams for your life were gone, and I understood what a tragedy is.\n\nI left the hotel and drove back to the hospital. I got lost on the way due to my exhaustion and also due to the fact that whoever designed the street layout for the city of Denver must also be responsible for designing some level of hell.\n\nWhen I got back, your mom was asleep and there was a fold out bed with sheets all ready for me to try and sleep in. I picked you up and held you for a little while longer before I tucked in for the night. I knew that the time to see your perfect figure was slowly dwindling and I wanted to take in as much as I could possibly get before I had to say goodbye. I kissed you on the forehead and placed you gently back into your crib. As I drifted off to sleep I thought about all of the times people have told me about wanting to wake up from a bad dream. For a long time, I've never really minded nightmares. I couldn't tell you why, but I've never really thought of them as something I've felt like I had to wake up from. To me nightmares are fun. You experience something awful and when you wake up, you think about how glad you are that you aren't living in that reality.\n\n>When I got the papers for your birth certificate and death certificate, I knew that for the first time my reality was a nightmare that I never wanted to wake up for.\n\n### When you met Gigi, Noe, Rachel, and Bri\nYour Grandma \"Gigi\" made it to the hospital around 5:30 am on Saturday. She and I hugged and cried for a while, and then she hugged your mom and cried for a while. She covered her face when she saw you in the crib for the first time, and cried some more. \"He's perfect, He's having so much fun with Grandpa Don right now\", she said. I climbed into the hospital bed, and tried to get a little more sleep in occasionally peering through my tired eyelids to see Gigi rocking you and loving you. across the room. \n\nA nurse came in and explained encouraged your mom that everything that happened was not her fault, and that there was know way for her to know that this was going to happen. She told us about her child that had passed 30 years prior, and how the grief never goes away, but that overtime it gets easier. She was so kind, and we were so thankful for her words.\n\nNonnie, Pops and Zoe came shortly afterwards with coffee, and there was more hugging and crying as the two grandmothers embraced for the first time since they received news of what had happened. After a while your aunt Rachel came and cried while holding you in her arms.\nA little while later your aunt Noelle, showed up and wept into your basinet. We were all feeling emotionally and physically exhausted.\n\nWe had a facetime with your aunt Bri who through her tears and sorrow shared beautiful words about you. We held the camera over you for her to see and she started to cry more as she took the site of you in. \n\nEveryone loved you so much.\n\n![giginoe](giginoe.JPG)\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; height: 500px; justify-content: center;\">\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ghettifish-llc/image/upload/a_0/v1549394809/CharlesThomas/IMG_5355.jpg\" alt=\"Meeting Rachel\" width=\"45%\" class=\"image\">\n</div>\n\n### When you met Boompah\nYour Grandpa Boompah was having a hard time getting to Denver, as one thing after another seemed to make it harder and harder for him to drive there. He finally made it to Denver around 12:30 and we could hear him already making friends with the whole hospital and saying something funny to the nurse that lead him to the room. When he got in, he dropped his bag, and gave me a hug. The world around me stopped as I sobbed into my dad's shoulder. He held me up as I continued to cry telling him about how amazing you are. I could hear everyone around me weeping and eventually Gigi asked him if he was \"ready to meet his grandson\". \"I don't know if I can\" he said as eyes welled up with tears. He walked over to the basinet and stood over you taking you in. I rubbed his back and told him that he should hold him. He mentioned that when he and mom had me he was worried that \"my head might roll off\", and that he was feeling that a little more so with you cause you were so tiny.\n\n![Pops and Boompah](popsandboompah.jpg)\nHe held you in his arms and asked the question: \"What does his life mean? What do you think it stands for.\" I told him that I believed that your life meant that \"there is good in all things.\"\n\n### There is good in all things.\n\nHow do you deal with a tragedy such as this? With dreams shattered, where can you go? Charles Thomas, your life is filled with purpose that we all have to come to terms with in our own way. I believe that your life is a symbol and a reminder that there is good in all things, and that just like you were, those good things can be small and easy to miss. We miss you so much.\n\nWith all of the sadness, it doesn't take much to let your emotions go towards feelings of sorrow and anger towards how cruel and unfair life is. Just like we collected the precious moments of time with Charles, I began to collect the small pieces of good that came during an unbearable situation. Here they are:\n1. We got to see you.\n2. We got to see you moving and alive.\n3. We got to hold you while you were alive.\n4. Your family got to meet you.\n5. Your Boompah was able to meet you in spite of being all of the way in Florida scheduled to fly much later than we would have been with you.\n6. Your Boompah made it through all of the traffic and car accidents in time to be with you.\n7. Your Nonnie, Pops and Aunt Zoe, all had a place to stay in our hotel room.\n8. The hospital was only 5 minutes away.\n9. The nurse that helped us at first gave us the helpful tip of saying \"20 weeks\" that got us into a wonderful birthing center with some of the best doctors in the state.\n10. The nurses in the hospital had everything they needed to make a wonderful box of memories for you.\n11. The nurses and doctors in the hospital knew exactly how to hold our hearts through the situation.\n12. I was there in Denver to be with your mother when you were born.\n13. Your mom didn't give birth on the street.\n14. Or in the car.\n15. Or in the hotel room.\n16. Or in some ill-equipped hospital.\n17. Your mom didn't have any medical emergency that put her in danger.\n18. You were perfect, in all of your tiny details.\n19. We got to spend your entire life on earth with you.\n20. You heard us tell you how much we love you.\n21. You felt our tears as they landed upon you.\n22. I was able to be led through your baptism.\n23. We received your life as a testament to the truth that there is good in all things.\n\n![Mom](mom.JPG)\n\n### When I said goodbye.\n\n![Family](family.JPG)\n\nWe gathered around the bed and everyone joined in prayer for all who were invested and effected by your life. We thanked God for the time with you and the circumstances surrounding that small amount of time with you. One by one your family took your body in their arms and said goodbye to you in their own special way. Your Pops said his goodbye and then delicately placed you back into the crib. Everyone left and it was just us. Your mom took you in her arms one more time and said he last goodbye's. I held you in the palm of my hand and told you the truth: \n\n\"You always were my son, and you always will be my son. This isn't a goodbye to you, but a goodbye to your body which was a beautiful container for your spirit during your short time with us. I love you so much, and look forward to the day that I can hold again\".  \n\nI believed all of this, but still it was so hard to say goodbye. I kissed you one more time and placed you back in the crib. We took the hat you were wearing and the blanket around you leaving you swaddled in the hospital blankets. We packed your memories box and gathered the last items from around your room. Then we left.\n\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ghettifish-llc/image/upload/a_0/v1549302179/CharlesThomas/goodbye.jpg\" alt=\"Saying Goodbye\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" class=\"image\">\n\n\n### Meeting Uncle Nat\nNathaniel Charles met Charles Thomas in spirit when we stopped by the house. It was our final stop for the evening and by this time, we could barely keep our eyes open. I hugged Nat so tightly and wept into his shoulder. Through my tears I whispered into his ears: \"Last night you became an uncle, and shortly after, you lost a nephew\". You could see in Nat's tearful eyes that he was so sad that he couldn't be there to hold him in person. He shared how sad he was to not be able to be the \"fun uncle\" for you, and how much he wanted to do fun things with him when he was old enough. We laid the pictures from your memorial box out on the table so he could see how precious you are. \"So this is where we all came from\" he said as he placed his index finger over the tiny prints left by your perfect hands. \"I'm here for you, so if there's anything you need, let me know\". It meant so much that we could share this time. I really do think Nat holds a special place in your heart as he is your one and only, and very cool uncle.\n\n### Where do we go from here?\n\nI never thought about funeral homes, and planning memorial services. These seemed like things I would do later in life when my parents pass, or maybe a dear friend. It was so hard to explain to the person over the phone that we needed to setup funeral arrangements for our infant son. \n\nWhen I woke up on Friday morning, I thought we'd be helping you learn how to write your name, not writing your name on a death certificate. I thought we'd get to see you struggle to walk for the first time, not struggle ourselves to walk to the car as we left the hospital. I thought you'd be baptized in your Pop's church, not in with the cold hospital water. I thought you'd be with us safely inside your mom's womb while we explored Hawaii in March. I thought you'd get to sleep in the crib we got for you, or ride in the stroller. I thought you'd be in the back seat of our car as we left the hospital instead of us being in the back of your grandparents car as they drove us home. I thought I'd see you grow into a man, instead I look in the mirror and see the man I became the day I lost you. I thought you'd bury me after having a family of your own.\n\nThere is good in all things, and for as long as we can, your mom and I will remember you for showing me that. Some day your brothers and sisters will hear your amazing story and eventually we will all be together after we cross through the waters that you crossed the night you were born.\n\nCharles Thomas Bovee, we love you so much and are all so thankful for every single second with you.\n\n-Your Dad.",

      "rawMarkdownBody": "\n### The day you were born.\nFebruary 1st started off like almost any other Friday recently. I woke up at 5:30am to get ready for work and made it to the office around 7am. There was a party at the office around noon, and my plans were to enjoy some time with the people there, and head to Denver to spend the weekend with your mom. Up until this point, I've been afraid of telling people about you. I've been afraid of the possibility of losing you. I didn't want to have to tell people who were excited to meet you, that the wouldn't get the chance.\n\nThat day was different. I felt encouraged by all of the doctors who told us that you were perfect, and everything looked fine. I beamed about you to some of my co-workers at that party for the first time. I told everyone how excited I was to be a father. It felt good to tell people about you.\n\nI left the office around 2pm and made it to the hotel around 3:30pm. Your mom looked beautiful waving at me from across the street. I gave her a kiss and after that she told me that she had been feeling what she believed to be [Braxton Hicks contractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braxton_Hicks_contractions). She was in Denver for an All State Choir event, and had to sing at a special performance for directors. I brought my things up to the hotel room, and that's when your mom said: \"I can feel him moving!\". I got to feel your tiny kick through your mothers belly for the first time, and I almost cried with excitement. You were such a ball of energy in there.\n\nWe left the hotel and went to the singalong. Your mom was still feeling the contractions. The performance was beautiful. 10 floors of kids singing from balconies. I know now that they were singing the celebration songs of your arrival into our arms. Your mom looked miserable when she met me after the concert, she knew that she had to go to a hospital. On the way back to the hotel, she keeled over in the street clutching her belly in pain. We knew that we had to get to the hospital fast, but still didn't know if this was just some early pains that were natural and part of the process. We told the valet that your mom was in labor and we needed the car as quickly as possible. They ran to the lot to get it and we were out of there and on the way to the hospital. On the way your mom kept saying: \"Baby, why do you want to come now?\".\n\n### When we got to the hospital.\nI helped your mom walk into the emergency room around 7:00. We explained to the nurses that you felt like you were having contractions, and that you might be going into labor. They asked how many weeks pregnant she was, and she replied \"19\". The nurse told us that tonight we would be \"20 weeks\" since that was the earliest that they could take us into the Labor facility. \"You don't want to be in an emergency room, you want to be upstairs\" the nurse told us.\n\nA nurse pushed your mom in a wheelchair for what seemed like a mile to get to the Labor center. We were in the hospital room within about 10 minutes of getting to the hospital. They had you into a bed and started to ask your mom question after question. \"How long have you felt this?\", \"Have you been drinking water?\", \"When's the last time you pooped?\". Your mom has gone to the hospital on several different occasions for several different pains, that have ended up being some feces in her bowels. I was really hoping that the end of this story could be: \"That was the third time I took Dani to an ER where a doctor told her she was full of crap.\" This time was different, because she was full of you, and we were both full of love for you.\n\nSeveral nurses were in the room trying to gather as much information as they could about your mom. Some of them were convinced that she was dehydrated and that it was the dehydration that was making her feel contractions. She explained that she felt like she needed to go to the bathroom really bad, and they told her she should try. When she came out of the bathroom she had a worried expression on her face and said: \"Something's coming out\". They pulled an ultrasound machine into the room to examine you. \"They're perfect. Do you want to know the gender?\" We were scheduled to find out in a few weeks but wanted to know now. \"It's a boy\".\n\nThe nurses had her get on the bed and brought a light in to examine. I wanted to see what was coming out, and sure enough, a small green bag was beginning to protrude. The nurses confidence that everything was going to be okay disappeared almost immediately after seeing that. She told us: \"Sweetheart that looks like your bag. We need to get a specialist in here\". They hooked your mom up to an IV and began to draw blood to test for infections. They inverted your mom so that they could hopefully have gravity coax her amniotic sac back inside to prevent it rupturing. The doctor rushed in and said that she needed to confirm that there were no infections before starting any sort of procedure to get the sac back inside.\n\nThey told her to take deep breaths and hang tight while they made the necessary preparations. Everyone left the room and for a while it was just me and your mom. I encouraged her that everything was going to be fine and that all of the nurses and doctors were doing everything they could to make sure that you and her would be safe. Your mom suddenly felt another contraction come on and said that we needed to get nurses in the room quickly. We called a nurse in and she inspected the sac again to make sure it was still intact, before leaving one more time. Your mom was calm for a little while longer, and then she felt another rush of pain and said again: \"Get someone in here\". We called the nurse again, and this time, all of the nurses and the doctor came back in. \"We're still waiting on results to begin this operation, your doing great, and everything is going to be fine.\" They offered her a drug to ease the pain, Fentanyl. She accepted it and as they were administrating it told her that she might feel dizzy. The drug seemed to calm her down a bit and the doctor and nurses were still urging her to stay calm and wait for the results. Suddenly, there was a sound of popping and a splash of liquid as your mom's water broke. \n\n### When you were born\n\nUp until this point I had stayed hopeful. My hope was that they could find a way to make sure that you stayed inside the womb. When your mom's water broke, almost all of that hope was gone. I had just a sliver of optimism as the doctor told us \"This is it. You're having this baby, and that means that it will not live. I'm sorry.\" Even the nurses words couldn't deplete that last bit of hope that maybe they were wrong, and maybe this was just some sort of misunderstanding. Maybe your mom had two water bags for some reason. Maybe you could be born tonight, and they could save you some how. Nothing could've prepared me for what happened next. Your mom cried out and there was a loud pop and a thud as you exploded out onto the table. That noise, was like a gunshot from a gun pointed at my heart, my hope, and everything that is good in my life. I was shattered in to billions of pieces. The last sliver of hope disappeared along with the hope I had for anything good in this world. \n\n>I wept harder than I have ever cried in my life. \n\nIt wasn't a wail, but an uncontrollable heaving. My face was buried into your mother's pillow, and my hat fell off of my head. The dreams of holding you in my arms were gone. My imagination of you experience life for the first time was replaced with a feeling of wishing my life had never happened. I thought it would never end. It was truly the most pain, I've ever experienced in my entire life. \n\nYou were born at 8:05pm in St. Luke's hospital on February 2nd, 2019.\n![Meeting you for the first time](firsttime.JPG)\n### After you were born.\nI never thought anyone was ready to be a parent. I thought that I would really never be ready, and that this feeling of being unprepared was just part of having children. Any fear I had, or feeling of not being ready dissolved the moment I saw your face for the first time.\n\n\"He's perfect, and he's yours to be with tonight\". Through my tears and heaving I looked down to see my incredible son pressed against the bosom of his mother. The structure of your tiny body resembled mine so much, it was as if I was looking at a miniaturized version of myself. You were almost 10 inches tall. I couldn't believe how much you had grown in the few months since we found out that we were expecting you.\n\nWe named you \"Charles Thomas\" after your two great grandfathers: Charles Bovee, and Thomas Darr. These two men are strong warriors like you, and the name suited you perfectly, because just like them, you're a strong warrior.\n\nIn between crying I held your hand on the tip of my finger. Your tiny fingers were incredible to behold. Miniature versions of my hands. You were kicking and squirming every little while. It was such a beautiful site to behold, but was also sad, as I knew these were kicks meant to develop your reflexes in the womb and not meant for the air of the earth. You were lying sideways pressed into your mom, your tiny feet were crossed and you were so peaceful. I couldn't believe how peaceful you were. You opened your mouth and lifted your chest as if to take a huge breath. \"He just took a breath\" your mom would say to me. I was deeply troubled by the fact that this wasn't you taking a deep breath, but attempting to breathe into lungs that were not yet developed. Each time you tried to take a breath, I was filled with even more sorrow. Life is so resilient, that even with the incomplete body you were born with, you fought hard to stay alive. I could see your tiny heart beat in your tiny neck beating slower and slower.\n\nYour mom and I took turns holding you, trying to take in as much of this precious time as we could. When I held you it felt like I was holding a little furnace. So much heat and energy and life in one little ball. I touched your tiny body as much as I could, and gave you so many kisses. You were bathed in my tears. It wasn't fair. \n\nThe chaplain came in and guided me through your baptism. She had forgotten the cup of water and as she went to get it I held your precious body and the palm of my hand, and thought about how much I wanted the best for you. When she came back in she lead us in prayer and I got to take small drops of water and \"In the name of the father\" baptise you. You kicked your legs for the last time I can remember as I made a tiny cross on your chest with the water. I knew that soon you would be in heaven with your uncles.\n\n### After you went to heaven.\n\nIt was hard to tell, because your heartbeat hadn't stopped abruptly but seemed to slow down. We think that you left this world sometime between 9:45 and 10:15, though it was really difficult to say.  We continued to take turns holding you and studying every precious detail on your tiny body. Your hands, feet, knees, neck, shoulders, bottom, head, face, eyelids, fingers, and tiny fingernails. You were so precious an so perfect. I couldn't stop crying. A nurse came in around 11 and confirmed that you had passed, and took you out of the room to prepare a small memory box with pictures and keepsakes that we could look at and remember you by.\n\nWe called your grandparents to let them know. We could've filled up a pool with the amount of tears that we all cried for you that night.\n\nEventually you were brought back into the room in a tiny little bassinet with a cute little hat and blanket. We got to hold you and take pictures of you in your cute outfit until the family members started to arrive.\n\n### The night you met Nonnie, Pops and Zoe\n\nYour Grandpa \"Pops\", and Grandmother \"Nonnie\", along with your Aunt Zoe, came to the hospital around 12:30. Pops and I hugged and sobbed into one another as we both processed the situation. Nonnie wept along with Zoe and Dani on the hospital bed. Eventually they all gathered around your crib to take in the magnificence of your precious face. They would take turns holding you, and your mom and I did our best to explain the events that had taken place that evening. After an hour or two of this time, I went with your family back to the hotel that Dani and I were planning on staying in. I helped them get the car into the Valet, and went with them up to the room to collect all of your mothers things.\n\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; height: 500px; justify-content: space-between;\">\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ghettifish-llc/image/upload/a_0/v1549302184/CharlesThomas/pops.jpg\" alt=\"Meeting Pops\" width=\"45%\" class=\"image\">\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ghettifish-llc/image/upload/a_0/v1549394809/CharlesThomas/IMG_5347.jpg\" alt=\"Meeting Nonnie\" width=\"45%\" class=\"image\">\n</div>\n\n### Understanding what tragedy means\nIn the silence of the elevator ride I thought about how different life was just a few hours earlier. My dreams for this weekend. My dreams for this month. My dreams for your first year. As I collected all of your mothers things from the hotel room, the reality set in that our life would never be the same, or even close to the way we dreamed it would be. For as long as I could think, I believed that a crime was any action by someone that effected someone else negatively. That night I learned a definition for a tragedy. A tragedy can be experienced by more than one person and is the result of an event that permanently removes one's ability to dream in specific areas of their life. There are very few things that fit this category. \n\nI'm a firm believer that life is full of opportunity, and that if you don't see it right away, you might find an amazing opportunity that others missed. To me, as long as there is life, the world is full of opportunity. For some people there is less opportunity, but there is still some there. I think that the only time opportunity disappears, is when someone dies. When we die, we can't have opportunities, at least in the way that we understand them in this life. When someone else dies, we lose any chance of opportunity to experience life with them. Or at least we lose the opportunity to experience this life with them. When you passed away, my dreams for your life were gone, and I understood what a tragedy is.\n\nI left the hotel and drove back to the hospital. I got lost on the way due to my exhaustion and also due to the fact that whoever designed the street layout for the city of Denver must also be responsible for designing some level of hell.\n\nWhen I got back, your mom was asleep and there was a fold out bed with sheets all ready for me to try and sleep in. I picked you up and held you for a little while longer before I tucked in for the night. I knew that the time to see your perfect figure was slowly dwindling and I wanted to take in as much as I could possibly get before I had to say goodbye. I kissed you on the forehead and placed you gently back into your crib. As I drifted off to sleep I thought about all of the times people have told me about wanting to wake up from a bad dream. For a long time, I've never really minded nightmares. I couldn't tell you why, but I've never really thought of them as something I've felt like I had to wake up from. To me nightmares are fun. You experience something awful and when you wake up, you think about how glad you are that you aren't living in that reality.\n\n>When I got the papers for your birth certificate and death certificate, I knew that for the first time my reality was a nightmare that I never wanted to wake up for.\n\n### When you met Gigi, Noe, Rachel, and Bri\nYour Grandma \"Gigi\" made it to the hospital around 5:30 am on Saturday. She and I hugged and cried for a while, and then she hugged your mom and cried for a while. She covered her face when she saw you in the crib for the first time, and cried some more. \"He's perfect, He's having so much fun with Grandpa Don right now\", she said. I climbed into the hospital bed, and tried to get a little more sleep in occasionally peering through my tired eyelids to see Gigi rocking you and loving you. across the room. \n\nA nurse came in and explained encouraged your mom that everything that happened was not her fault, and that there was know way for her to know that this was going to happen. She told us about her child that had passed 30 years prior, and how the grief never goes away, but that overtime it gets easier. She was so kind, and we were so thankful for her words.\n\nNonnie, Pops and Zoe came shortly afterwards with coffee, and there was more hugging and crying as the two grandmothers embraced for the first time since they received news of what had happened. After a while your aunt Rachel came and cried while holding you in her arms.\nA little while later your aunt Noelle, showed up and wept into your basinet. We were all feeling emotionally and physically exhausted.\n\nWe had a facetime with your aunt Bri who through her tears and sorrow shared beautiful words about you. We held the camera over you for her to see and she started to cry more as she took the site of you in. \n\nEveryone loved you so much.\n\n![giginoe](giginoe.JPG)\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; height: 500px; justify-content: center;\">\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ghettifish-llc/image/upload/a_0/v1549394809/CharlesThomas/IMG_5355.jpg\" alt=\"Meeting Rachel\" width=\"45%\" class=\"image\">\n</div>\n\n### When you met Boompah\nYour Grandpa Boompah was having a hard time getting to Denver, as one thing after another seemed to make it harder and harder for him to drive there. He finally made it to Denver around 12:30 and we could hear him already making friends with the whole hospital and saying something funny to the nurse that lead him to the room. When he got in, he dropped his bag, and gave me a hug. The world around me stopped as I sobbed into my dad's shoulder. He held me up as I continued to cry telling him about how amazing you are. I could hear everyone around me weeping and eventually Gigi asked him if he was \"ready to meet his grandson\". \"I don't know if I can\" he said as eyes welled up with tears. He walked over to the basinet and stood over you taking you in. I rubbed his back and told him that he should hold him. He mentioned that when he and mom had me he was worried that \"my head might roll off\", and that he was feeling that a little more so with you cause you were so tiny.\n\n![Pops and Boompah](popsandboompah.jpg)\nHe held you in his arms and asked the question: \"What does his life mean? What do you think it stands for.\" I told him that I believed that your life meant that \"there is good in all things.\"\n\n### There is good in all things.\n\nHow do you deal with a tragedy such as this? With dreams shattered, where can you go? Charles Thomas, your life is filled with purpose that we all have to come to terms with in our own way. I believe that your life is a symbol and a reminder that there is good in all things, and that just like you were, those good things can be small and easy to miss. We miss you so much.\n\nWith all of the sadness, it doesn't take much to let your emotions go towards feelings of sorrow and anger towards how cruel and unfair life is. Just like we collected the precious moments of time with Charles, I began to collect the small pieces of good that came during an unbearable situation. Here they are:\n1. We got to see you.\n2. We got to see you moving and alive.\n3. We got to hold you while you were alive.\n4. Your family got to meet you.\n5. Your Boompah was able to meet you in spite of being all of the way in Florida scheduled to fly much later than we would have been with you.\n6. Your Boompah made it through all of the traffic and car accidents in time to be with you.\n7. Your Nonnie, Pops and Aunt Zoe, all had a place to stay in our hotel room.\n8. The hospital was only 5 minutes away.\n9. The nurse that helped us at first gave us the helpful tip of saying \"20 weeks\" that got us into a wonderful birthing center with some of the best doctors in the state.\n10. The nurses in the hospital had everything they needed to make a wonderful box of memories for you.\n11. The nurses and doctors in the hospital knew exactly how to hold our hearts through the situation.\n12. I was there in Denver to be with your mother when you were born.\n13. Your mom didn't give birth on the street.\n14. Or in the car.\n15. Or in the hotel room.\n16. Or in some ill-equipped hospital.\n17. Your mom didn't have any medical emergency that put her in danger.\n18. You were perfect, in all of your tiny details.\n19. We got to spend your entire life on earth with you.\n20. You heard us tell you how much we love you.\n21. You felt our tears as they landed upon you.\n22. I was able to be led through your baptism.\n23. We received your life as a testament to the truth that there is good in all things.\n\n![Mom](mom.JPG)\n\n### When I said goodbye.\n\n![Family](family.JPG)\n\nWe gathered around the bed and everyone joined in prayer for all who were invested and effected by your life. We thanked God for the time with you and the circumstances surrounding that small amount of time with you. One by one your family took your body in their arms and said goodbye to you in their own special way. Your Pops said his goodbye and then delicately placed you back into the crib. Everyone left and it was just us. Your mom took you in her arms one more time and said he last goodbye's. I held you in the palm of my hand and told you the truth: \n\n\"You always were my son, and you always will be my son. This isn't a goodbye to you, but a goodbye to your body which was a beautiful container for your spirit during your short time with us. I love you so much, and look forward to the day that I can hold again\".  \n\nI believed all of this, but still it was so hard to say goodbye. I kissed you one more time and placed you back in the crib. We took the hat you were wearing and the blanket around you leaving you swaddled in the hospital blankets. We packed your memories box and gathered the last items from around your room. Then we left.\n\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ghettifish-llc/image/upload/a_0/v1549302179/CharlesThomas/goodbye.jpg\" alt=\"Saying Goodbye\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" class=\"image\">\n\n\n### Meeting Uncle Nat\nNathaniel Charles met Charles Thomas in spirit when we stopped by the house. It was our final stop for the evening and by this time, we could barely keep our eyes open. I hugged Nat so tightly and wept into his shoulder. Through my tears I whispered into his ears: \"Last night you became an uncle, and shortly after, you lost a nephew\". You could see in Nat's tearful eyes that he was so sad that he couldn't be there to hold him in person. He shared how sad he was to not be able to be the \"fun uncle\" for you, and how much he wanted to do fun things with him when he was old enough. We laid the pictures from your memorial box out on the table so he could see how precious you are. \"So this is where we all came from\" he said as he placed his index finger over the tiny prints left by your perfect hands. \"I'm here for you, so if there's anything you need, let me know\". It meant so much that we could share this time. I really do think Nat holds a special place in your heart as he is your one and only, and very cool uncle.\n\n### Where do we go from here?\n\nI never thought about funeral homes, and planning memorial services. These seemed like things I would do later in life when my parents pass, or maybe a dear friend. It was so hard to explain to the person over the phone that we needed to setup funeral arrangements for our infant son. \n\nWhen I woke up on Friday morning, I thought we'd be helping you learn how to write your name, not writing your name on a death certificate. I thought we'd get to see you struggle to walk for the first time, not struggle ourselves to walk to the car as we left the hospital. I thought you'd be baptized in your Pop's church, not in with the cold hospital water. I thought you'd be with us safely inside your mom's womb while we explored Hawaii in March. I thought you'd get to sleep in the crib we got for you, or ride in the stroller. I thought you'd be in the back seat of our car as we left the hospital instead of us being in the back of your grandparents car as they drove us home. I thought I'd see you grow into a man, instead I look in the mirror and see the man I became the day I lost you. I thought you'd bury me after having a family of your own.\n\nThere is good in all things, and for as long as we can, your mom and I will remember you for showing me that. Some day your brothers and sisters will hear your amazing story and eventually we will all be together after we cross through the waters that you crossed the night you were born.\n\nCharles Thomas Bovee, we love you so much and are all so thankful for every single second with you.\n\n-Your Dad.",

        "content": "\nThis is a story of goodness. This is a story about a little boy who was every good thing in my life. \n\nOn October 20th, Nic and I found out that we were pregnant with our first child. The first two emotions to flow through me were excitement and fear. My biggest dream in life has been to be a mother. I’ve always known I was born to be a mother. It is a part of my calling. The excitement rushed through me as I became aware that my biggest dream was coming true. The fear came with all of the thoughts of “what will it be like?” “what type of mother will I be?”“how is my life going to change?” and “what if things end badly?” These are fears that went away as I settled into the fact that this was going to be the best journey that Nic and I would take together. \n\nAs the weeks progressed, I became obsessed with pregnancy and all of the development our baby was going through. I had three different apps, 4 different books, and I watched at least 40 YouTube videos about what to eat, what type of exercise to do (not that I did any), what type of baby clothes to buy, and what was the BEST type of stroller and car seat. I wanted my baby’s life to be perfect. I didn’t want to OVER spoil him, but I wanted him to have everything. I even researched what type of pre-school our child should eventually go to. The one thing that I was most obsessed with researching was the percentage for miscarriage at certain weeks in the pregnancy. Each week, the percentage got smaller, and it was addicting to know that I got through just one more week. When the first trimester **finally** ended, I was blissful. I thought that it was smooth sailing from there. We told the internet, took maternity pictures, and even bought our child his first stuffy and hat (though we didn’t know it was a boy). \n\n![Deer](deer.JPG)\n\nIt became so fun to dream about all of the things we would get to do with our child, like take them on their first camping trip, buy them their first lego set, teach them how to read books, ride a bike, and just watch them experience this life for the first time. We loved guessing if it was a boy or girl and everybody had a gut feeling it was a little boy in there. I finally got around to making a registry of all of the essentials that we would need and even set a date for our baby shower. It took me about 15 weeks to finally settle into the fact that “THIS WAS HAPPENING!” \n\nAfter waiting and waiting, around 17 weeks, I felt the first baby flutters. These quickly became little kicks that I would feel every night before I went to sleep. I so looked forward to laying down and feeling our baby dance inside my womb. It was so addicting to feel him alive and well inside my body. The first time I felt him besides right before bed was during choir rehearsal. He would kick and kick whenever the music was being sung. I knew he would love music just like his mommy and daddy. I became so settled in the joy that our little baby was bringing already that I had no fear. I was on cloud 9. I loved looking in the mirror and seeing my little bump get a little bit bigger each week. \n\nWe had an appointment set for Feb. 12th to do an anatomy scan and find out the gender. I had it in my calendar and was literally counting down the days. I couldn’t wait until I found out if it was a boy or girl and I definitely couldn’t wait to know for sure that he was doing well and that everything was developing correctly. My classes were so excited for me to do a gender reveal and my students were already taking bets on whether it was a boy or girl. I couldn’t wait to celebrate with them when I found out.\n\nOn Friday, Feb. 1st, I was 19 weeks and 5 days pregnant. I was in Denver on a trip to All-State choir with my student Hayden. Thursday night check-in and rehearsal had gone really well and we were having a great time! We got to go to The Cheesecake Factory and have dinner on Thursday night and then we got to bed at about 10 pm to get ready for a big day of rehearsals on Friday. I went to bed blissful as I felt my little baby keeping me company in that big empty hotel room. The next day, I had rehearsal monitor duty first thing in the morning. We had an amazing continental breakfast at the hotel and then went to our 8 o'clock rehearsal. I did the tardy recording for the tenor/bass choir and then was done. At 9:00 we had a directors meeting to talk about all of the All-State changes for next year and we got to meet new directors. It’s always amazing to see just how many directors there are in Colorado. I’m so glad to be one of them.  At 9:30, I went back to the hotel, grabbed some decaf coffee and a muffin and went up to my room. I laid down and watched a couple episodes of “Grace and Frankie” which is a new show that I got into. \n\nThen, when lunch came around I walked back to the Embassy Suites and checked in with Hayden. He decided to go to Smash Burger with his friends and I didn’t want to be weird so I just went by myself to a place called “Mixed Greens” and ordered an Asian salad. It was *so good*. Hayden would’ve hated it because he doesn’t like vegetables. I drank a natural root beer and walked around the 16th street mall. I loved people watching and feeling the energy of the city. Hayden and I then went back to the Embassy to watch the All-State Jazz concert. It was incredible! During the All-State jazz performance, I felt a cramp that was like a period cramp. I decided to go back to my room and wait until Nic got here. I watched another episode of Grace and Frankie and then heated up my leftover spaghetti and was just relaxing on my bed. I went to the bathroom around 3:00 after feeling a couple more cramps and when I wiped, there was a bit of blood. I had a pang of pain in my heart and fear came back like a flood. Oh no. I told myself to not panic and just go lay down. I laid down and the pain was still there in my belly. \n\n>Some things in life are so unexpected that it just takes your breath away. Some things are so out of your control that you feel like you are on a roller coaster and you want to get off but it’s already going 60 miles per hour and you can’t stop it even if you tried. Nic and I were on that unstoppable roller coaster from the day we found out we were pregnant. We knew from the beginning that this was in God’s hands. As I laid in my bed, feeling the pain and feeling our child kick my hand, I cried out in my heart, \"please God, help us.\"\n\nAt around 3:30, Nic showed up. I walked down to meet him outside and the cramps were so strong it hurt to stand- it just felt like a bad period. I told Nic and we went back up to the hotel room and talked about it. We thought it may just be Braxton-Hicks contractions and that they should go away. They were just dull period cramps, and I didn’t think it was anything to worry about. We walked to Embassy because I had my director choir rehearsal then the balcony sing. During the balcony sing, my cramps got so bad I couldn’t stand and I started sweating, that's when I started to think this was bad and that I needed to go to the hospital. I started freaking out a little bit and told Nic we had to go- like now. I told Hayden, Hunter, and Hunter's director that I had to go to the hospital because I was having bad stomach pains. As we were walking to the hotel the contractions amped up and it became SO painful to walk. I was trying not to panic. I kept thinking not tonight-I can’t be having the baby. I called Emi and my mom and Christi and dad but Christi was the only one to pick up. I asked her what Braxton Hicks contractions were like and told her that we were going to the hospital. At this point, I was dizzy with the pain and could barely talk. We got to the hotel but our cars were in the valet parking lot, Nic told the valet person that this was an emergency and he had no doubt because I was sitting on the pavement crying and clenching in pain. They got our car out as fast as possible and Nic was en route to the nearest hospital which was luckily only 5 minutes away. The contractions were becoming stronger and closer together in the car and I had to cross my legs to keep myself from pushing which is exactly what my body was wanting to do. I felt consumed with grief already because in my heart, I knew this was bad- really bad. Having Nic by my side assuring me that we didn't know for sure what was happening was a relief. He had so much hope and I started to believe that maybe he was right- maybe it was going to be okay. \n\nWhen we got to the ER they saw that I was in labor and put me straight up into the labor and delivery unit. They got me in a wheelchair and it felt like it took them forever to get across the hospital to the unit I needed to be in. When we got to our room, they had me try to pee in a cup. I couldn’t pee- I didn’t want to push because I felt like the baby would just pop out. They put a contraction monitor on my belly and sure enough I was having contractions every couple of minutes. They really wanted me to pee in a cup so after drinking a lot of water, I had to pee. \n\nWhen I went pee, I was wiping and felt something coming out of my vagina. I can’t even describe the amount of fear I had at that moment. I thought it was the baby. I came out of the bathroom practically naked and told them that there was something coming out of my vagina. They looked inside and sure enough, the entire water sack was slipping out. They got an ultrasound machine in the room and looked at my uterus. Sure enough, my water sack was slipping out because I was almost fully dilated. They asked me if I wanted to know if it was a boy or girl and I said yes. They said it’s a boy! I knew it. I had a wave of joy crash over me at the news of it being a boy, but that joy was quickly followed by pure fear when they told me that they would have to push the sack back into my contracting uterus and then sew it up in order to save this baby. I was willing to do anything to save my sweet boy but in the meantime, my uterus had other plans- it was still contracting out of my control. They inverted my bed so that gravity was pushing the sack back into my body. It was extremely uncomfortable because my body was trying to push it out. The doctors needed to do blood tests so they stuck a needle in my hand and drew blood. They needed to see that I didn’t have an infection before they could sew up my uterus with the baby inside. They didn’t even have time to get the blood test done and make the decision before my contractions were so strong I was crying out in pain. They decided to put me back flat so that all the blood wasn’t rushing to my head. I heard a big pop as the water broke came crashing out. Less than a minute later something else came out and the doctor said: “that was the baby.” \n\nBy this point they had me on an IV with some drugs going into my system- I think more for the emotional trauma I was going through than the physical pain. I was in shock. I couldn’t hear anything they were saying I just watched as our little teeny tiny baby boy was picked up by the nurse. They clamped the umbilical cord and cut it. They asked if I wanted to do skin to skin and I nodded yes. Meanwhile, the doctor had her hand up in me trying to pull the placenta out. She told me to push and it only took about three big pushes before the placenta came out. It was so shocking to see all of the blood on the nurses and doctors hands and to all of a sudden have my son put on my chest. I was on that roller coaster and this was what was happening. He was so little, but he was so perfect. He had all of his fingers and toes and was so cute. I couldn’t even cry- I was in shock. All I could hear was my sweet husband sobbing over us. I could feel his tears shower us with his love. The doctor was explaining what had happened, but I couldn’t really listen. I was just staring at this perfect little person on my chest and feeling Nic beside me. \n\nThey explained to us that there was no hope for him- it was just too early in the development and even if he did survive, he would live a life with serious problems. I could just feel mine and Nic’s hearts breaking at the same time. But instead of breaking once, it felt like each heartbeat we witnessed was another shatter of our heart. He was alive in this world- our son was alive. We didn’t know how many heartbeats we had with him but the doctors and nurses were amazing. They left us and let us have alone time with our precious son. We looked at every inch of him and talked about every little detail. He had Nic’s body structure for sure- strong and tall and so perfect. He had my little ears and a mix of mine and Nic’s feet. He had my double jointed hands and he had the most perfect cute face I have ever seen. He had his auntie Bri's nose and you could see that he was already developing the famous Bovee Brows. He had the most perfect body and we just couldn’t believe that he was still breathing and that his heart was still beating. The doctors were surprised at how long he lasted and we were so thankful. They asked if he had a name and we decided to give him the names of our grandfathers, Charles Thomas Bovee. They wrote it down and it just felt so good that he had a name- it is a strong name for the strongest little boy in the world.\n\nAfter about 30 minutes, the Chaplin came in to baptize Charles. We prayed over him and Nic got to baptize him with some water from the tiniest little cup. I felt so much peace at that moment but I also felt so much loss. I didn’t have enough time with him- I was being crushed under the reality of this journey. Why was this happening? \n\nAfter the baptism, we took turns holding him on our chests. We didn’t ever want to leave this moment. I just wished that he would live. His heart rate slowed down but it was still beating and finally, we saw some fluid come out of his nose and he closed his mouth. I knew that this was it- our son was leaving to go be with the father in heaven. Even though the sadness I was feeling was indescribable- I couldn’t help but feel thankful for our time with our son. I just love him so much and was thankful to witness life in him.\n\nThe nurse told us that this is our time with him and that we can sleep with him and hold him for as long as we want. She did say that she could take pictures and get his weight and height and also do his foot and hand prints. We let her take him and while she was doing that, we called each of the parents and sisters. The grief was amplified as our family learned of the news. It really was a testament to the power of family and community. \n\nZoe and my parents decided to come down that night and Christi and Noelle and Rachel and Mark were going to come in the morning. The nurse, Annie, brought Charles back in and weighed him at 10 oz and he was 10 inches long! He was very tall for his age- that is Nic coming out in him again. She gave him back to us and reassured us that there was no time limit. We could spend as much time with him as we wanted. No time is enough time. \n![Mom and Charles](momandcharles.JPG)\n\nEventually, the doctor came back in and described why this happened. My cervix was thinning over time and I had no idea, so I was dilating but I wasn’t having painful contractions the whole time- it’s what they call ghost labor. They assured me that I would have babies in the future, but I will be at high risk for pre-term labor again so they will have to sew my cervix shut and give me hormones to keep it tight. Though the sadness was crushing me this whole time and I felt like I had let Charles down, it gave me hope that this wasn’t it. I just felt betrayed by my body- it didn’t even show any symptoms of anything happening until it was too late. There was literally nothing I could do- but I wished there was. She assured me that I shouldn’t blame myself and that the grief would be a long process- in fact, this would never leave us- but it would get easier. I was assured at the thought that I never had to forget Charles- I never had to \"get over it\" because in my heart I knew that to be an impossible task. My heart was changed. My life was changed. I would never be the same. I was a mommy.\n\n![Mom and Dad](momanddad.JPG)\nShe left and Nic and I just sat there holding our precious son as we waited for my parents and Zoe to get there. When they got there, another wave came crashing over us of this heartbreaking journey we had been set on. My parents and Zoe wept with us as they took turns holding Charles in their arms. I thanked them for coming to endure this with us because I know it is a sensitive experience for my family. My mom and dad lost two of their own son’s in a similar way. Zoe lost her twin in a similar way. I didn’t know how it was going to be for them. Even though it was crushing for them to watch this happen, they were so thankful to get to see Charles in person and to hold him in their arms. I was also thankful and in awe that he got to be in his grandparents’ arms too. We all prayed together and eventually they had to go to bed as it was now 1 in the morning. Nic went with them to the hotel to get them settled in and in the meantime, Nic put Charles in my arms and I got some alone time with him. I just stroked his face and told him that I was sorry for this happening to him. I told him over and over how much I loved him and that he was perfect and how proud I was. It was so heartbreaking to look at him- this perfect creation and know that my time with him was so short. He was so peaceful but I was in turmoil. It felt good to have his body next to me- I was used to having him inside me. I missed him so much already. The nurse put him in his cold bassinet because I was about to fall asleep and when I did, it was only for an hour before the nurse came back in to hook me up to some antibiotics at 4 am. By that time, Christi was on her way and I couldn’t go back to sleep. Nic came over and laid in bed with me and we tried to rest our eyes until Christi got there. When she did, another wave of grief came over us as she hugged her son and felt his grief. She got some precious alone time with Charles as well holding his little body and looking at his face. Her tears showered him with love and Nic and I rested our eyes as she sat and held him- it was comforting to know he was in loving arms. I was exhausted. \n\nAt 7:30, Rachel came from Greeley and yet another wave of grief showered over us as she saw her little nephew and held him. It was comforting to have her there with us and I felt like my sisters and parents and my husband were really holding me together at that point. A little bit later, my parents and Zoe came back and it was really good to have them there. I wanted to FaceTime Bri and that was just such a tender moment because she was sobbing and we were all sobbing. She has such a tender heart and I know that she felt so alone in Montana. I wished we could’ve teleported her to Denver to hold Charles. It was so good to have everybody in there. We eventually hung up the phone and a little bit after that Noelle showed up. She was just heartbroken to see her nephew and her brother and me so crushed and she was so sweet to Nic and me. She got to hold Charles and I loved watching her look at him. \n\nMark was the last person who was going to come. He was flying home from Florida and was going to land in CO Springs at 10 am, then drive down to Denver. Of course, we were happy to wait for him because that meant more time with Charles’ body. Mark got stuck in traffic, but eventually, he showed up. At this point, we were all crashed with another wave of grief because Nic really let it all loose when he started hugging his daddy. I wondered if it was because of that Father-Son bond that he was grieving with his son. We all lost it. We knew our time was shortening and I felt like half of me just wanted to leave because it was just too hard, but the other half of me was clinging to our son with all of my might- never wanting to leave him and his perfect little face. \n\nWe circled around the hospital bed and prayed. It was a holy time for my family. We prayed against fear and any lies that the enemy was trying to plant. We prayed for comfort and for grace and peace. It was holy and beautiful. We passed our son around to Pops, Nonnie, Auntie Rachel, Auntie Zoe, Auntie Noelle, GiGi, and finally BoomPa. They all gave their final kiss and goodbye and packed up their stuff to wait for us in the waiting room. Nic and I had asked if we could do our final goodbye together in private. \n\nI stood up and Nic and I collapsed in each other's embrace, sobbing because it was coming to a close- our time with our son in this world. I cannot even describe the amount of love that I felt for my husband Nic. This man that was literally my support and my comforter. Everything that we had gone through in our life together was all leading up to this moment. He is perfect for me in every way and I saw that perfection in our time with Charles. I’ve never seen another human being love so much. I could tangibly feel Nic’s love for Charles and me. It was overwhelming and really kept me floating above the sadness. I became so thankful for Nic and for his life and all that he was doing for me and all the had done for me and all that I knew he would do for me in the future. This man was made for me and all I could think of as we hugged and got ready to say goodbye to our son was, “for better or for worse” and we had definitely experienced the worst. I couldn’t have done it with anybody else by my side.\n\n >The little comfort I had walking up to the bassinet to say my final goodbye was that Nic was feeling the grief equally. We felt equally broken. We loved our boy equally, and we shared this heavy burden. \n\nI kissed my son and said my final goodbye and then Nic took him to the window to let the sunlight pour out on his little face and sobbed one last cry over his son and showered him in more loving tears. He finally set him down. The hardest part was walking out of that room. I wanted to take Charles and run, but of course, I knew that he needed to be at peace. And so we left our son and went to be with our family. The rest of the day was a haze. We drove back to Colorado Springs with my family and went to lunch. I cried during lunch and I felt like it couldn’t be real. I kept touching my flat tummy and became overwhelmed with grief every time. \n\nWe stopped by Ranny and Papa’s and cried some more with my grandparents. They have been through this many times and it doesn’t get easier. Eventually, we got back up to Woodland Park and took Charles’ box of his pictures and teddy bear to the Bovee’s house to show Nat because he was the only family member that didn’t get to come down and hold him. Another wave of grief crashed over us as yet another one of our family members embraced the loss and reality of what had happened. Nat was Charles’ only uncle and he was so sad that he never got to do the fun uncle things and he was really grieving what could’ve been- just like us. \n\nWe finally got home and it felt weird. Nic and I were constantly touching- we didn’t like being apart because we felt so fragile. We got ready for bed right away and were in bed at about 6:30 (we had only gotten about 1.5 hours of sleep the previous day). We cried in each other's arms until we finally fell asleep. I woke up at 3 in the morning to go to the bathroom and cried some more. When I got back to bed, Nic was awake and we cuddled and he fell back asleep but I couldn’t and I cried and cried. Finally, I fell asleep. \n\nThis morning we woke up at 9 am and cried some more. I asked Nic, “What do we do now?” He said, “unfortunately, we call the funeral home and plan our son’s memorial and we cry.” And that is what we did. We told more friends and the grief expanded. When will it end? I don’t think I will ever get over this tragic and traumatic event, but I am hoping that the doctor is right about it getting easier because this is hard. \n\nNic and I know that Charles’ life purpose was fulfilled in the two and a half hours he was alive in our arms. He is a symbol of the good in everything. He is our joy and goodness embodied and we will always remember him that way. He is pure and he is thankfulness and he is holy. We created a beautiful human with a beautiful life purpose and we will always be impacted by his life. For such a small boy, he left a huge mark on our hearts and our lives. He confirmed our purpose of being parents and he really bonded Nic and I together during his time in our arms. I will never forget our sweet poppy- our tall, handsome, active, and precious son. The most innocent, and pure, and perfect person in our lives. We will always try to live our lives through the filter that there is goodness in every situation. Charles taught us that. As I look back, I still feel as though this is the best journey Nic and I will take. This journey lead us to Charles. This journey taught us what deep love truly is. This journey is our life. I will never stop sharing this amazing story and I will never forget our son Charles Thomas Bovee. We love you every day of forever and cannot wait to hold you in heaven. \n\nLove, your mommy\n\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; height: 500px; justify-content: center;\">\n    <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ghettifish-llc/image/upload/a_0/v1549394620/CharlesThomas/weloveyou.jpg\" width=\"50%\" alt=\"We Love you\">\n</div>\n",

      "rawMarkdownBody": "\nThis is a story of goodness. This is a story about a little boy who was every good thing in my life. \n\nOn October 20th, Nic and I found out that we were pregnant with our first child. The first two emotions to flow through me were excitement and fear. My biggest dream in life has been to be a mother. I’ve always known I was born to be a mother. It is a part of my calling. The excitement rushed through me as I became aware that my biggest dream was coming true. The fear came with all of the thoughts of “what will it be like?” “what type of mother will I be?”“how is my life going to change?” and “what if things end badly?” These are fears that went away as I settled into the fact that this was going to be the best journey that Nic and I would take together. \n\nAs the weeks progressed, I became obsessed with pregnancy and all of the development our baby was going through. I had three different apps, 4 different books, and I watched at least 40 YouTube videos about what to eat, what type of exercise to do (not that I did any), what type of baby clothes to buy, and what was the BEST type of stroller and car seat. I wanted my baby’s life to be perfect. I didn’t want to OVER spoil him, but I wanted him to have everything. I even researched what type of pre-school our child should eventually go to. The one thing that I was most obsessed with researching was the percentage for miscarriage at certain weeks in the pregnancy. Each week, the percentage got smaller, and it was addicting to know that I got through just one more week. When the first trimester **finally** ended, I was blissful. I thought that it was smooth sailing from there. We told the internet, took maternity pictures, and even bought our child his first stuffy and hat (though we didn’t know it was a boy). \n\n![Deer](deer.JPG)\n\nIt became so fun to dream about all of the things we would get to do with our child, like take them on their first camping trip, buy them their first lego set, teach them how to read books, ride a bike, and just watch them experience this life for the first time. We loved guessing if it was a boy or girl and everybody had a gut feeling it was a little boy in there. I finally got around to making a registry of all of the essentials that we would need and even set a date for our baby shower. It took me about 15 weeks to finally settle into the fact that “THIS WAS HAPPENING!” \n\nAfter waiting and waiting, around 17 weeks, I felt the first baby flutters. These quickly became little kicks that I would feel every night before I went to sleep. I so looked forward to laying down and feeling our baby dance inside my womb. It was so addicting to feel him alive and well inside my body. The first time I felt him besides right before bed was during choir rehearsal. He would kick and kick whenever the music was being sung. I knew he would love music just like his mommy and daddy. I became so settled in the joy that our little baby was bringing already that I had no fear. I was on cloud 9. I loved looking in the mirror and seeing my little bump get a little bit bigger each week. \n\nWe had an appointment set for Feb. 12th to do an anatomy scan and find out the gender. I had it in my calendar and was literally counting down the days. I couldn’t wait until I found out if it was a boy or girl and I definitely couldn’t wait to know for sure that he was doing well and that everything was developing correctly. My classes were so excited for me to do a gender reveal and my students were already taking bets on whether it was a boy or girl. I couldn’t wait to celebrate with them when I found out.\n\nOn Friday, Feb. 1st, I was 19 weeks and 5 days pregnant. I was in Denver on a trip to All-State choir with my student Hayden. Thursday night check-in and rehearsal had gone really well and we were having a great time! We got to go to The Cheesecake Factory and have dinner on Thursday night and then we got to bed at about 10 pm to get ready for a big day of rehearsals on Friday. I went to bed blissful as I felt my little baby keeping me company in that big empty hotel room. The next day, I had rehearsal monitor duty first thing in the morning. We had an amazing continental breakfast at the hotel and then went to our 8 o'clock rehearsal. I did the tardy recording for the tenor/bass choir and then was done. At 9:00 we had a directors meeting to talk about all of the All-State changes for next year and we got to meet new directors. It’s always amazing to see just how many directors there are in Colorado. I’m so glad to be one of them.  At 9:30, I went back to the hotel, grabbed some decaf coffee and a muffin and went up to my room. I laid down and watched a couple episodes of “Grace and Frankie” which is a new show that I got into. \n\nThen, when lunch came around I walked back to the Embassy Suites and checked in with Hayden. He decided to go to Smash Burger with his friends and I didn’t want to be weird so I just went by myself to a place called “Mixed Greens” and ordered an Asian salad. It was *so good*. Hayden would’ve hated it because he doesn’t like vegetables. I drank a natural root beer and walked around the 16th street mall. I loved people watching and feeling the energy of the city. Hayden and I then went back to the Embassy to watch the All-State Jazz concert. It was incredible! During the All-State jazz performance, I felt a cramp that was like a period cramp. I decided to go back to my room and wait until Nic got here. I watched another episode of Grace and Frankie and then heated up my leftover spaghetti and was just relaxing on my bed. I went to the bathroom around 3:00 after feeling a couple more cramps and when I wiped, there was a bit of blood. I had a pang of pain in my heart and fear came back like a flood. Oh no. I told myself to not panic and just go lay down. I laid down and the pain was still there in my belly. \n\n>Some things in life are so unexpected that it just takes your breath away. Some things are so out of your control that you feel like you are on a roller coaster and you want to get off but it’s already going 60 miles per hour and you can’t stop it even if you tried. Nic and I were on that unstoppable roller coaster from the day we found out we were pregnant. We knew from the beginning that this was in God’s hands. As I laid in my bed, feeling the pain and feeling our child kick my hand, I cried out in my heart, \"please God, help us.\"\n\nAt around 3:30, Nic showed up. I walked down to meet him outside and the cramps were so strong it hurt to stand- it just felt like a bad period. I told Nic and we went back up to the hotel room and talked about it. We thought it may just be Braxton-Hicks contractions and that they should go away. They were just dull period cramps, and I didn’t think it was anything to worry about. We walked to Embassy because I had my director choir rehearsal then the balcony sing. During the balcony sing, my cramps got so bad I couldn’t stand and I started sweating, that's when I started to think this was bad and that I needed to go to the hospital. I started freaking out a little bit and told Nic we had to go- like now. I told Hayden, Hunter, and Hunter's director that I had to go to the hospital because I was having bad stomach pains. As we were walking to the hotel the contractions amped up and it became SO painful to walk. I was trying not to panic. I kept thinking not tonight-I can’t be having the baby. I called Emi and my mom and Christi and dad but Christi was the only one to pick up. I asked her what Braxton Hicks contractions were like and told her that we were going to the hospital. At this point, I was dizzy with the pain and could barely talk. We got to the hotel but our cars were in the valet parking lot, Nic told the valet person that this was an emergency and he had no doubt because I was sitting on the pavement crying and clenching in pain. They got our car out as fast as possible and Nic was en route to the nearest hospital which was luckily only 5 minutes away. The contractions were becoming stronger and closer together in the car and I had to cross my legs to keep myself from pushing which is exactly what my body was wanting to do. I felt consumed with grief already because in my heart, I knew this was bad- really bad. Having Nic by my side assuring me that we didn't know for sure what was happening was a relief. He had so much hope and I started to believe that maybe he was right- maybe it was going to be okay. \n\nWhen we got to the ER they saw that I was in labor and put me straight up into the labor and delivery unit. They got me in a wheelchair and it felt like it took them forever to get across the hospital to the unit I needed to be in. When we got to our room, they had me try to pee in a cup. I couldn’t pee- I didn’t want to push because I felt like the baby would just pop out. They put a contraction monitor on my belly and sure enough I was having contractions every couple of minutes. They really wanted me to pee in a cup so after drinking a lot of water, I had to pee. \n\nWhen I went pee, I was wiping and felt something coming out of my vagina. I can’t even describe the amount of fear I had at that moment. I thought it was the baby. I came out of the bathroom practically naked and told them that there was something coming out of my vagina. They looked inside and sure enough, the entire water sack was slipping out. They got an ultrasound machine in the room and looked at my uterus.

I had a wave of joy crash over me at the news of it being a boy, but that joy was quickly followed by pure fear when they told me that they would have to push the sack back into my contracting uterus and then sew it up in order to save this baby. I was willing to do anything to save my sweet boy but in the meantime, my uterus had other plans- it was still contracting out of my control. They inverted my bed so that gravity was pushing the sack back into my body. It was extremely uncomfortable because my body was trying to push it out. The doctors needed to do blood tests so they stuck a needle in my hand and drew blood. They needed to see that I didn’t have an infection before they could sew up my uterus with the baby inside. They didn’t even have time to get the blood test done and make the decision before my contractions were so strong I was crying out in pain. They decided to put me back flat so that all the blood wasn’t rushing to my head. I heard a big pop as the water broke came crashing out. Less than a minute later something else came out and the doctor said: “that was the baby.” \n\nBy this point they had me on an IV with some drugs going into my system- I think more for the emotional trauma I was going through than the physical pain. I was in shock. I couldn’t hear anything they were saying I just watched as our little teeny tiny baby boy was picked up by the nurse. They clamped the umbilical cord and cut it. They asked if I wanted to do skin to skin and I nodded yes. Meanwhile, the doctor had her hand up in me trying to pull the placenta out. She told me to push and it only took about three big pushes before the placenta came out. It was so shocking to see all of the blood on the nurses and doctors hands and to all of a sudden have my son put on my chest. I was on that roller coaster and this was what was happening. He was so little, but he was so perfect. He had all of his fingers and toes and was so cute. I couldn’t even cry- I was in shock. All I could hear was my sweet husband sobbing over us. I could feel his tears shower us with his love. The doctor was explaining what had happened, but I couldn’t really listen. I was just staring at this perfect little person on my chest and feeling Nic beside me. \n\nThey explained to us that there was no hope for him- it was just too early in the development and even if he did survive, he would live a life with serious problems. I could just feel mine and Nic’s hearts breaking at the same time. But instead of breaking once, it felt like each heartbeat we witnessed was another shatter of our heart. He was alive in this world- our son was alive. We didn’t know how many heartbeats we had with him but the doctors and nurses were amazing. They left us and let us have alone time with our precious son. We looked at every inch of him and talked about every little detail. He had Nic’s body structure for sure- strong and tall and so perfect. He had my little ears and a mix of mine and Nic’s feet. He had my double jointed hands and he had the most perfect cute face I have ever seen. He had his auntie Bri's nose and you could see that he was already developing the famous Bovee Brows. He had the most perfect body and we just couldn’t believe that he was still breathing and that his heart was still beating. The doctors were surprised at how long he lasted and we were so thankful. They asked if he had a name and we decided to give him the names of our grandfathers, Charles Thomas Bovee. They wrote it down and it just felt so good that he had a name- it is a strong name for the strongest little boy in the world.\n\nAfter about 30 minutes, the Chaplin came in to baptize Charles. We prayed over him and Nic got to baptize him with some water from the tiniest little cup. I felt so much peace at that moment but I also felt so much loss. I didn’t have enough time with him- I was being crushed under the reality of this journey. Why was this happening? \n\nAfter the baptism, we took turns holding him on our chests. We didn’t ever want to leave this moment. I just wished that he would live. His heart rate slowed down but it was still beating and finally, we saw some fluid come out of his nose and he closed his mouth. I knew that this was it- our son was leaving to go be with the father in heaven. Even though the sadness I was feeling was indescribable- I couldn’t help but feel thankful for our time with our son. I just love him so much and was thankful to witness life in him.\n\nThe nurse told us that this is our time with him and that we can sleep with him and hold him for as long as we want. She did say that she could take pictures and get his weight and height and also do his foot and hand prints. We let her take him and while she was doing that, we called each of the parents and sisters. The grief was amplified as our family learned of the news. It really was a testament to the power of family and community. \n\nZoe and my parents decided to come down that night and Christi and Noelle and Rachel and Mark were going to come in the morning. The nurse, Annie, brought Charles back in and weighed him at 10 oz and he was 10 inches long! He was very tall for his age- that is Nic coming out in him again. She gave him back to us and reassured us that there was no time limit. We could spend as much time with him as we wanted. No time is enough time. \n![Mom and Charles](momandcharles.JPG)\n\nEventually, the doctor came back in and described why this happened. My cervix was thinning over time and I had no idea, so I was dilating but I wasn’t having painful contractions the whole time- it’s what they call ghost labor. They assured me that I would have babies in the future, but I will be at high risk for pre-term labor again so they will have to sew my cervix shut and give me hormones to keep it tight. Though the sadness was crushing me this whole time and I felt like I had let Charles down, it gave me hope that this wasn’t it. I just felt betrayed by my body- it didn’t even show any symptoms of anything happening until it was too late. There was literally nothing I could do- but I wished there was. She assured me that I shouldn’t blame myself and that the grief would be a long process- in fact, this would never leave us- but it would get easier. I was assured at the thought that I never had to forget Charles- I never had to \"get over it\" because in my heart I knew that to be an impossible task. My heart was changed. My life was changed. I would never be the same. I was a mommy.\n\n![Mom and Dad](momanddad.JPG)\nShe left and Nic and I just sat there holding our precious son as we waited for my parents and Zoe to get there. When they got there, another wave came crashing over us of this heartbreaking journey we had been set on. My parents and Zoe wept with us as they took turns holding Charles in their arms. I thanked them for coming to endure this with us because I know it is a sensitive experience for my family. My mom and dad lost two of their own son’s in a similar way. Zoe lost her twin in a similar way. I didn’t know how it was going to be for them. Even though it was crushing for them to watch this happen, they were so thankful to get to see Charles in person and to hold him in their arms. I was also thankful and in awe that he got to be in his grandparents’ arms too. We all prayed together and eventually they had to go to bed as it was now 1 in the morning. Nic went with them to the hotel to get them settled in and in the meantime, Nic put Charles in my arms and I got some alone time with him. I just stroked his face and told him that I was sorry for this happening to him. I told him over and over how much I loved him and that he was perfect and how proud I was. It was so heartbreaking to look at him- this perfect creation and know that my time with him was so short. He was so peaceful but I was in turmoil. It felt good to have his body next to me- I was used to having him inside me. I missed him so much already. The nurse put him in his cold bassinet because I was about to fall asleep and when I did, it was only for an hour before the nurse came back in to hook me up to some antibiotics at 4 am. By that time, Christi was on her way and I couldn’t go back to sleep. Nic came over and laid in bed with me and we tried to rest our eyes until Christi got there. When she did, another wave of grief came over us as she hugged her son and felt his grief. She got some precious alone time with Charles as well holding his little body and looking at his face. Her tears showered him with love and Nic and I rested our eyes as she sat and held him- it was comforting to know he was in loving arms. I was exhausted. \n\nAt 7:30, Rachel came from Greeley and yet another wave of grief showered over us as she saw her little nephew and held him. It was comforting to have her there with us and I felt like my sisters and parents and my husband were really holding me together at that point. A little bit later, my parents and Zoe came back and it was really good to have them there. I wanted to FaceTime Bri and that was just such a tender moment because she was sobbing and we were all sobbing. She has such a tender heart and I know that she felt so alone in Montana. I wished we could’ve teleported her to Denver to hold Charles. It was so good to have everybody in there. We eventually hung up the phone and a little bit after that Noelle showed up. She was just heartbroken to see her nephew and her brother and me so crushed and she was so sweet to Nic and me. She got to hold Charles and I loved watching her look at him. \n\nMark was the last person who was going to come. He was flying home from Florida and was going to land in CO Springs at 10 am, then drive down to Denver. Of course, we were happy to wait for him because that meant more time with Charles’ body. Mark got stuck in traffic, but eventually, he showed up. At this point, we were all crashed with another wave of grief because Nic really let it all loose when he started hugging his daddy. I wondered if it was because of that Father-Son bond that he was grieving with his son. We all lost it. We knew our time was shortening and I felt like half of me just wanted to leave because it was just too hard, but the other half of me was clinging to our son with all of my might- never wanting to leave him and his perfect little face. \n\nWe circled around the hospital bed and prayed. It was a holy time for my family. We prayed against fear and any lies that the enemy was trying to plant. We prayed for comfort and for grace and peace. It was holy and beautiful. We passed our son around to Pops, Nonnie, Auntie Rachel, Auntie Zoe, Auntie Noelle, GiGi, and finally BoomPa. They all gave their final kiss and goodbye and packed up their stuff to wait for us in the waiting room. Nic and I had asked if we could do our final goodbye together in private. \n\nI stood up and Nic and I collapsed in each other's embrace, sobbing because it was coming to a close- our time with our son in this world. I cannot even describe the amount of love that I felt for my husband Nic. This man that was literally my support and my comforter. Everything that we had gone through in our life together was all leading up to this moment. He is perfect for me in every way and I saw that perfection in our time with Charles. I’ve never seen another human being love so much. I could tangibly feel Nic’s love for Charles and me. It was overwhelming and really kept me floating above the sadness. I became so thankful for Nic and for his life and all that he was doing for me and all the had done for me and all that I knew he would do for me in the future. This man was made for me and all I could think of as we hugged and got ready to say goodbye to our son was, “for better or for worse” and we had definitely experienced the worst. I couldn’t have done it with anybody else by my side.\n\n >The little comfort I had walking up to the bassinet to say my final goodbye was that Nic was feeling the grief equally. We felt equally broken. We loved our boy equally, and we shared this heavy burden. \n\nI kissed my son and said my final goodbye and then Nic took him to the window to let the sunlight pour out on his little face and sobbed one last cry over his son and showered him in more loving tears. He finally set him down. The hardest part was walking out of that room. I wanted to take Charles and run, but of course, I knew that he needed to be at peace. And so we left our son and went to be with our family. The rest of the day was a haze. We drove back to Colorado Springs with my family and went to lunch. I cried during lunch and I felt like it couldn’t be real. I kept touching my flat tummy and became overwhelmed with grief every time. \n\nWe stopped by Ranny and Papa’s and cried some more with my grandparents. They have been through this many times and it doesn’t get easier. Eventually, we got back up to Woodland Park and took Charles’ box of his pictures and teddy bear to the Bovee’s house to show Nat because he was the only family member that didn’t get to come down and hold him. Another wave of grief crashed over us as yet another one of our family members embraced the loss and reality of what had happened. Nat was Charles’ only uncle and he was so sad that he never got to do the fun uncle things and he was really grieving what could’ve been- just like us. \n\nWe finally got home and it felt weird. Nic and I were constantly touching- we didn’t like being apart because we felt so fragile. We got ready for bed right away and were in bed at about 6:30 (we had only gotten about 1.5 hours of sleep the previous day). We cried in each other's arms until we finally fell asleep. I woke up at 3 in the morning to go to the bathroom and cried some more. When I got back to bed, Nic was awake and we cuddled and he fell back asleep but I couldn’t and I cried and cried. Finally, I fell asleep. \n\nThis morning we woke up at 9 am and cried some more. I asked Nic, “What do we do now?” He said, “unfortunately, we call the funeral home and plan our son’s memorial and we cry.” And that is what we did. We told more friends and the grief expanded. When will it end? I don’t think I will ever get over this tragic and traumatic event, but I am hoping that the doctor is right about it getting easier because this is hard. \n\nNic and I know that Charles’ life purpose was fulfilled in the two and a half hours he was alive in our arms. He is a symbol of the good in everything. He is our joy and goodness embodied and we will always remember him that way. He is pure and he is thankfulness and he is holy. We created a beautiful human with a beautiful life purpose and we will always be impacted by his life. For such a small boy, he left a huge mark on our hearts and our lives. He confirmed our purpose of being parents and he really bonded Nic and I together during his time in our arms. I will never forget our sweet poppy- our tall, handsome, active, and precious son. The most innocent, and pure, and perfect person in our lives. We will always try to live our lives through the filter that there is goodness in every situation. Charles taught us that. As I look back, I still feel as though this is the best journey Nic and I will take. This journey lead us to Charles. This journey taught us what deep love truly is. This journey is our life. I will never stop sharing this amazing story and I will never forget our son Charles Thomas Bovee. We love you every day of forever and cannot wait to hold you in heaven. \n\nLove, your mommy\n\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; height: 500px; justify-content: center;\">\n    <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ghettifish-llc/image/upload/a_0/v1549394620/CharlesThomas/weloveyou.jpg\" width=\"50%\" alt=\"We Love you\">\n</div>\n",
