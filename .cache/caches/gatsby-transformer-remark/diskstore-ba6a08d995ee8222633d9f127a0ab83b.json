We walked to Embassy because I had my director choir rehearsal then the balcony sing. During the balcony sing, my cramps got so bad I couldn’t stand and I started sweating, that's when I started to think this was bad and that I needed to go to the hospital. I started freaking out a little bit and told Nic we had to go- like now. I told Hayden, Hunter, and Hunter's director that I had to go to the hospital because I was having bad stomach pains. As we were walking to the hotel the contractions amped up and it became SO painful to walk. I was trying not to panic. I kept thinking not tonight-I can’t be having the baby. I called Emi and my mom and Christi and dad but Christi was the only one to pick up. I asked her what Braxton Hicks contractions were like and told her that we were going to the hospital.

Sure enough, my water sack was slipping out because I was almost fully dilated. They asked me if I wanted to know if it was a boy or girl and I said yes. They said it’s a boy! I knew it. I had a wave of joy crash over me at the news of it being a boy, but that joy was quickly followed by pure fear when they told me that they would have to push the sack back into my contracting uterus and then sew it up in order to save this baby. I was willing to do anything to save my sweet boy but in the meantime, my uterus had other plans- it was still contracting out of my control. They inverted my bed so that gravity was pushing the sack back into my body. It was extremely uncomfortable because my body was trying to push it out. The doctors needed to do blood tests so they stuck a needle in my hand and drew blood. They needed to see that I didn’t have an infection before they could sew up my uterus with the baby inside. They didn’t even have time to get the blood test done and make the decision before my contractions were so strong I was crying out in pain.

I thanked them for coming to endure this with us because I know it is a sensitive experience for my family. My mom and dad lost two of their own son’s in a similar way.

Even though it was crushing for them to watch this happen, they were so thankful to get to see Charles in person and to hold him in their arms. I was also thankful and in awe that he got to be in his grandparents’ arms too. We all prayed together and eventually they had to go to bed as it was now 1 in the morning. Nic went with them to the hotel to get them settled in and in the meantime, Nic put Charles in my arms and I got some alone time with him. I just stroked his face and told him that I was sorry for this happening to him. I told him over and over how much I loved him and that he was perfect and how proud I was. It was so heartbreaking to look at him- this perfect creation and know that my time with him was so short. He was so peaceful but I was in turmoil. It felt good to have his body next to me- I was used to having him inside me. I missed him so much already. The nurse put him in his cold bassinet because I was about to fall asleep and when I did, it was only for an hour before the nurse came back in to hook me up to some antibiotics at 4 am. By that time, Christi was on her way and I couldn’t go back to sleep. Nic came over and laid in bed with me and we tried to rest our eyes until Christi got there. When she did, another wave of grief came over us as she hugged her son and felt his grief. She got some precious alone time with Charles as well holding his little body and looking at his face.
